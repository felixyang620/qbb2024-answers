# Exercise 2.3
1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell? 

Exon. Because on the graph, as the MAF increases, exon's expression value decreases the most. 

2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases? 

Because with lower MAFs, it means that there is not much of minor alleles being expressed, this is due to more common variants being expressed by the population, so as the most features, they stand out more as a natural consequence. As the MAF increaes, this means that more minor alleles are shown up instead of those common ones, this makes the features being "covered" up by those rare alleles. 

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.

Yes. They are approximately the same, with exon as a stand out. This may due to the fact that those are noncoding regions that are not targeted for the pressure from selection, while the exon, the coding region is selected against to make the actual allele expression arrangments, so it is being affected the most.
