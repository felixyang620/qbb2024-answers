## 3.1 What do each of these values mean, based on the descriptions of what is being labeled? 

The nascent RNA data means the level of the transcription of certain gene, the PCNA staining signal gives the protein expression level, which represents the translation level of that gene eventually. The log2(ratio) is the processed representation interpretation of the ratio between the two, to see how transcription level is related to the translation level of that gene. 

## 3.2 Look at the knocked-down gene with the highest ratio and the one with the lowest ratio. Look up what their functions are and explain if you think this result makes sense.

The highest ratio is APEX1, which encodes for AP endonuclease in human cells. This makes sense because this endonuclease is important for DNA damage repair mechanism. The lowest ratio is SRSF1, which encodes for the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (a critical factor in pre-mRNA splicing). This also makes sense as the splicing factors level is low, nascent mRNA processing decreases and the overall transcription/translation ratio goes down.
